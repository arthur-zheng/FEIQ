# Welcome to _Front-end Interview Questions_

This gitbook is a **collection** of the interview questions I have either came across in an real interview or seen during research.

I wrote this because there's **not** a lot of stuffs about front-end interview questions around on the internet. Hope it can help you somehow.

Why this book?

 1. Best quality examples.
 2. Fully covers.
